# Irrigation System

The Irrigation System is designed to automatically water plants based on their needs. It uses sensors to monitor soil moisture levels and adjusts the watering schedule accordingly.

## Hardware Components

- Soil moisture sensor: Measures the moisture content in the soil.
- Water pump: Delivers water to the plants when needed.
- Microcontroller: Collects data from sensors and controls the water pump.

# Intelligent Car System

The Intelligent Car System is responsible for the mobility of the overall system. It allows the irrigation system to move around and cover a larger area.

## Hardware Components

- Motors: Provide motion to the car.
- Wheels: Enable the car to move.
- Battery: Supplies power to the motors and other electronic components.

# Soft Design and Function

The software part of the system ensures seamless integration between the irrigation system and the intelligent car system.

## 1) Path Planning

The system uses path planning algorithms to navigate efficiently and avoid obstacles while moving from one plant to another.

## 2) Infrared Sensor Activation

Infrared sensors detect obstacles and help the system navigate safely.

## 3) Light-sensitive Sensor

The light-sensitive sensor measures the ambient light, ensuring optimal lighting conditions for plant growth.

## 4) Irrigation System

The software component of the irrigation system receives data from the soil moisture sensors and controls the water pump accordingly.
